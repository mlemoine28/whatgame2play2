## 💡 Motivation
If you’re a gamer like me, you’ve probably found yourself sitting in front of your PC or console after a long day, staring at your ever-growing backlog of games, unsure of what to play. You think, “Maybe I should buy another game to add to my already ridiculously large collection.” Before you know it, an hour goes by and you haven’t actually picked a game to play at all. Frustrated, you log off and head to bed after yet another wasted evening due to indecisiveness. Sound familiar?

This is where WhatGame2Play comes in.

<strong><li>Recommendations </strong> - Have game suggestions pop-up, based on games that are added to the playlist.</li>
<strong><li>Game Prices </strong>  - Show a list of storefronts with current prices.</li>
<strong><li>Usernames and Community </strong>  - Create an account to save your list of games, and see your friends profiles and what games they are excited to play!</li>
