WhatGame2Play was developed during Module Two of the Get Building (formerly Get Coding) program.
## Motivation
If you’re a gamer like me, you’ve probably found yourself sitting in front of your PC or console after a long day, staring at your ever-growing backlog of games, unsure of what to play. You think, “Maybe I should buy another game to add to my already ridiculously large collection.” Before you know it, an hour goes by and you haven’t actually picked a game to play at all. Frustrated, you log off and head to bed after yet another wasted evening due to indecisiveness. Sound familiar?

This is where WhatGame2Play comes in.

## What is it?
WhatGame2Play is designed to help you find a great game to play. It gives you options to narrow down your list of games based on parameters that matter to you. Choose from a variety of genres, 50 platforms spanning modern to classic systems, and tons of features such as co-op, third-person, or pixel graphics. 

When you see a game that catches your eye, simply add it to your playlist! In no time, you’ll have a list of games that you won’t hesitate to dive into.

## 🧰 Features
WhatGame2Play uses the RAWG Video Games Database API. The games, images, tags, genres, and platforms are all populated from it. I also used React Bootstrap for a few features, such as a loading spinner, and for pagination on the results page.

## 📝 In the future, I plan to implement:

*Filtering - After performing a search, adjust the search without having to make a brand new one. Ex: Sort games from newest to oldest; sort games by length; etc. <br>
*Recommendations - Have game suggestions pop-up, based on games that are added to the playlist. <br>
*Game Prices - Show a list of storefronts with current prices. <br> 
*Usernames and Community - Create an account to save your list of games, and see your friends profiles and what games they are excited to play!
