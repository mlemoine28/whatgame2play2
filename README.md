WhatGame2Play was developed during Module Two of the Get Building (formerly Get Coding) program.

If you’re a gamer like me, you’ve probably found yourself sitting in front of your PC or console after a long day, staring at your ever-growing backlog of games, unsure of what to play. You think, “Maybe I should buy another game to add to my already ridiculously large collection.” Before you know it, an hour goes by and you haven’t actually picked a game to play at all. Frustrated, you log off and head to bed after yet another wasted evening due to indecisiveness. Sound familiar?

This is where WhatGame2Play comes in.

WhatGame2Play is designed to help you find a great game to play. It gives you options to narrow down your list of games based on parameters that matter to you. Choose from a variety of genres, 50 platforms spanning modern to classic systems, and tons of features such as co-op, third-person, or pixel graphics. 

When you see a game that catches your eye, simply add it to your playlist! In no time, you’ll have a list of games that you won’t hesitate to dive into.

WhatGame2Play uses the RAWG Video Games Database API. The games, images, tags, genres, and platforms are all populated from it. I also used React Bootstrap for a few features, such as a loading spinner, and for pagination on the results page.

In the future, I plan to implement:

*Filtering - After performing a search, adjust the search without having to make a brand new one. Ex: Sort games from newest to oldest; sort games by length; etc. <br>
*Recommendations - Have game suggestions pop-up, based on games that are added to the playlist. <br>
*Game Prices - Show a list of storefronts with current prices. <br> <br>

Special thanks to the Get Building program and my coach Matt Vey. I am truly grateful for Matt's guidance and I appreciate all his valuable insights and patience he showed me throughout my journey into coding.
